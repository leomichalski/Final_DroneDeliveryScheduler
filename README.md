# Final_DroneDeliveryScheduler

This algorithm decides the best combination of deliveries that will be made by the drones. It takes into account the availability of drones at the moment, the total flight time of each drone (in pixels), the time of each delivery and the revenue generated by each delivery. So the final goal is to find the combination of flights that maximizes revenue according to the variables mentioned.
